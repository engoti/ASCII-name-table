# ASCII-name-table
is a simple Python program that accepts two names (entered in "last name, first name" format) as input from the user. It then displays the names in alphabetical order.

How It Works
The program prompts the user to input two names:

name1: The first name entered (last name, first name).
name2: The second name entered (last name, first name).
The program compares the two names to determine their alphabetical order.

It prints the names, ensuring that they are displayed in alphabetical order.

Input Format
The names should be entered in the format: "Last Name, First Name" (e.g., "Smith, John").
The program compares the names lexicographically (character by character).
Example Usage
Input:
sql
Copy code
Enter a name (last name first): Johnson, Mary
Enter another name (last name first): Adams, Robert
Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Here are the names, listed alphabetically.
Adams, Robert
Johnson, Mary
Requirements
Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
How to Run
Save the program code in a .py file (e.g., alphabetical_sorter.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the program using the command:

Copy code
python ASCII.py
Follow the prompts to enter names and view the output.

Notes
The program does not handle edge cases like improper input formatting or identical names.
To extend the program:
Add input validation to ensure proper formatting.
Allow multiple names for comparison.
Enjoy sorting names! ðŸ˜Š
